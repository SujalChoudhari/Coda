# Coda
## C++ Objects Dynamic Architecture
Coda is a C++-based interpreted language designed to allow for rapid development and execution of code. 
Its built-in functions and libraries simplify common programming tasks, improving productivity. 
Coda also offers high performance and versatility thanks to its implementation in C++. 


## Features

- **Interpreted Language:** Coda is an interpreted language, 
allowing for rapid development and execution of code. 
Its interpreter is implemented in C++, ensuring high performance and versatility.

- **Utility-Focused:** Coda aims to be a versatile utility language, 	
providing a wide range of functionalities and tools to simplify common programming tasks. 
It focuses on improving productivity by offering convenient built-in functions and libraries.

## Getting Started

To start using Coda, follow these steps:

1. Install the Coda interpreter.
2. Write your Coda code in a text file with the `.coda` extension.
3. Run the Coda interpreter with the path to your Coda file as an argument. 
   For example, if your Coda file is named `hello.coda`, you would run the interpreter as follows:
   ```
   Coda hello.coda
   
   OR
   
   Coda.exe hello.coda
   ```

# Development Roadmap

- [x] Strings
- [x] Variables (Assignment - dynamic)
- [x] Variables (Assignment - constants)
- [x] Variables (Look Up)
- [x] Objects (Js-like objects)
- [x] Native Functions  (printing,inputs,sleep)
- [x] BuiltIn Functions (parse<data-type>,conversions)
- [x] User Defined functions
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Control Statements (if statements)
- [ ] Control Statements (for loops)
