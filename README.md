# Coda
## C++ Objects Dynamic Architecture
Coda is an interpreted utility language designed to provide a flexible and efficient programming experience. 
The name "Coda" represents its ability to complement existing coding languages by serving as a valuable addition 
or extension to any software development project.

## Features

- **Interpreted Language:** Coda is an interpreted language, 
allowing for rapid development and execution of code. 
Its interpreter is implemented in C++, ensuring high performance and versatility.

- **Utility-Focused:** Coda aims to be a versatile utility language, 	
providing a wide range of functionalities and tools to simplify common programming tasks. 
It focuses on improving productivity by offering convenient built-in functions and libraries.

## Getting Started

To start using Coda, follow these steps:

1. Install the Coda interpreter.
2. Write your Coda code in a text file with the `.coda` extension.
3. Run the Coda code by executing the interpreter with the path to your code file.
	Simply Run the Code, and start using it as a editor.

# Development Roadmap
- [x] Lexer/Tokenizer
- [x] Parser
- [x] Interpreter
- [ ] Number Datatypes (int,float,byte,double) (removed)
- [x] Boolean Types (bool, uses c++ boolean in background)
- [x] Strings
- [x] Variables (Assignment - dynamic)
- [x] Variables (Assignment - constants)
- [x] Variables (Look Up)
- [x] Objects (Js-like objects)
- [x] Native Functions  (printing,inputs,sleep)
- [ ] User Defined functions
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] BuiltIn Functions (parse<data-type>,conversions)
- [ ] Control Statements (if statements)
- [ ] Control Statements (for loops)
- [ ] Control Statements (while loops)
- [ ] Control Statements (forEach loops)
- [ ] Packages (importing and creating, potentially in C++ dll's))
- [ ] Object-Orientation
